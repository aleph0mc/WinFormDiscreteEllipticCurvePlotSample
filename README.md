# WinFormDiscreteEllipticCurvePlotSample
Sample Discrete plot of an elliptic curve  
  
 y^2 = x^3 + a*x + b (mod p)  
   
 Where  
 p = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007908834671663  
 a = 0  
 b = 7  
   
 Loop count limited to 10,000.  
   
 It contains a sample and very basic code representing bitcoin mining,  
   
   *private static void computeBitcoinHash()*  
     
 which is not actually used in the demo.
